# Abstract

Here, I try to motivate a log-normal prior on the bias parameter in `updog`.

# Analysis

Two is a little exteme
```{r}
r <- 2
updog::plot_problines(0.01, exp(r), 6)
```

3 is a very extreme and it's hard for me to every imagine seeing such data.
```{r}
r <- 3
updog::plot_problines(0.01, exp(r), 6)
```

1 is about as much bias as I want
```{r}
r <- -1
updog::plot_problines(0.01, exp(r), 6)
```

If we just do a N(0, 1) prior on the log, then we would see 2 only about 5 percent of the time. This is an extreme case of bias, so I don't might setting it this much. 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
