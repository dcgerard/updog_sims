# Abstract

Here, I try to get some intuition behind the Balding-Nichols model.

# Set up

The Balding-Nichols model states that the genotype for individual $i$ is distributed $BB(K, p, F_i)$, where $K$ is the ploidy of the species, $p$ is the allele-frequency, and $F_i$ is the individual-specific "inbreeding coefficient." The reason why this isn't saturated is that each genetic locus shares the same $F_i$. Hence, they estimate the $F_i$ jointy with all loci.
